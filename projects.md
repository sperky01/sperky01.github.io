### Genomics Annotation Services

> A fully operational software-as-a-service for genomics analysis served on AWS.

The software consists of multiple components, including a web app (an interface for users to upload files and check job status), an annotation service (a process by which a sequenced genome sample is analyzed to identify the location of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome, and determine what those genes do), and several utility programs such as notifying users via email when jobs are done, archiving files for free users from s3 to glacier, and restoring files for free users once they subscribe to become premium users. Utilized load balancers and auto-scalers for scaling purposes and performed load testing using Locust and simple scripts. 


### Functional Adventure

> A text adventure game (similar to Colossal Cave Adventure) written in Haskell.

The player can walk to any room on the map and also retrace their steps. The player can also take and drop items, subject to a maximum weight limit. The winning state of the game is for the player to carry 'jug' into 'backyard'. I designed the game by following the 'functional core/imperative shell' approach.
